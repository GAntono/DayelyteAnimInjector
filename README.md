DayelyteAnimInjector
====================

A script to register animations, requested by Dayelyte.

A perceived de-motivational factor for Skyrim animators is the lack of an easy way to inject their creations into the game.
This script was designed for animators who are not familiar with scripting, to facilitate animation registration.

The animator will be able to edit this script template according to the instructions to inject any and all of his animations.
